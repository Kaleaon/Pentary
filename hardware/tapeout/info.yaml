  title: "Pentary 3T Processor"
  author: "Pentary Computing Project"
  description: |
    A balanced base-5 (pentary) arithmetic processor using 3-transistor 
    analog logic principles. Features a 4-digit pentary ALU with add, 
    subtract, and negate operations. Supports both digital and analog 
    I/O for native pentary signal processing.

  # Tile configuration
  tiles: "2x2"  # Options: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 4x2

  # Analog pins (requires additional cost)
  analog_pins: 6  # Options: 0, 2, 4, 6

  # Top module name (must match Verilog)
  top_module: "tt_um_pentary_3t"

  # Source files (relative to src/)
  source_files:
    - "tt_um_pentary_3t.v"

  # Clock configuration
  clock_hz: 10000000  # 10 MHz target

  # External hardware needed
  external_hw: |
    For digital operation: None required.
    For analog operation:
      - 0.8V precision reference voltage
      - 10µA bias current source
      - 5-level DAC for input
      - 5-level ADC for output
