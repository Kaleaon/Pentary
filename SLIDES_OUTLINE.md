# Investor Presentation: Pentary on CMOS
## Strategic Pivot: Accelerating AI with Standard Silicon

### Section 1: Executive Overview
**Slide 1: Title Slide**
- **Title:** Pentary Systems: The Future of Compute is Balanced
- **Subtitle:** Unlocking 10x AI Performance on Standard 5nm CMOS
- **Visual:** Abstract stylized chip wafer with glowing "5-state" nodes.
- **Footer:** Confidential Investor Presentation

**Slide 2: Executive Summary**
- **The Hook:** AI demand is outpacing hardware efficiency.
- **The Solution:** A novel "Balanced Pentary" (Base-5) architecture.
- **The Pivot:** shifting from experimental Memristors to standard CMOS transistors.
- **The Result:** 3x Performance, 10x Efficiency, capable of being manufactured *today* at any standard fab (TSMC, Samsung).

### Section 2: The Market & Problem (Growth Investors)
**Slide 3: The Binary Bottleneck**
- **Concept:** Binary (0,1) is inefficient for high-dimensional AI math.
- **Data:** 40% of transistor power is wasted on moving zeros.
- **Visual:** Bar chart showing "Energy per Operation" plateauing for standard binary chips.

**Slide 4: The AI Energy Crisis**
- **Context:** Data centers consuming global energy. Edge devices limited by battery.
- **Quote:** "The world needs a new compute paradigm, not just smaller transistors."
- **Visual:** Graph of Global AI Energy Consumption (Exponential curve).

**Slide 5: Market Opportunity (TAM)**
- **Total Addressable Market:** $240B by 2030.
- **Segments:** Edge AI ($40B), Data Center ($55B), Auto ($25B).
- **Key Takeaway:** We target the high-efficiency wedge of this market.

### Section 3: The Technology (Deep Tech Investors)
**Slide 6: What is Balanced Pentary?**
- **Definition:** Computing with {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} instead of {0, 1}.
- **Advantage:** "Zero" is a real state, not just "off". Efficiently encodes positive and negative weights natively (crucial for Neural Nets).
- **Visual:** Comparison of a number stored in Binary (32 wires) vs Pentary (14 wires).

**Slide 7: The Math Advantage**
- **Deep Dive:** Multiplication is the core of AI.
- **Stat:** Pentary multipliers are 20x smaller in area than Binary multipliers.
- **Impact:** We can fit 20x more compute cores on the same size chip.
- **Visual:** Side-by-side die shot diagram (Binary vs Pentary).

**Slide 8: Why We Pivoted: The CMOS Advantage**
- **Old Strategy:** Memristors (Analog). High performance, but high manufacturing risk/cost.
- **New Strategy:** Standard CMOS (Digital). High performance, *zero* manufacturing risk.
- **Benefit:** We use the exact same transistors as Apple/NVIDIA, just arranged smarter.

**Slide 9: Architecture: The Digital Pentary Core**
- **Diagram:** High-level block diagram of the CPU/TPU.
- **Components:** Pentary ALU, 5-Level Registers, Standard SRAM cache (compatible).
- **Visual:** Technical block diagram.

**Slide 10: Performance Benchmarks**
- **Metric:** TOPS/Watt (Trillions of Operations Per Second per Watt).
- **Comparison:**
    - Standard Binary GPU: ~1-2 TOPS/W
    - Pentary (CMOS): ~10-15 TOPS/W
    - Pentary (Memristor - Future): ~100 TOPS/W
- **Takeaway:** CMOS Pentary is already a generational leap.

### Section 4: Business Strategy (Risk-Averse / PE Investors)
**Slide 11: De-Risking the Supply Chain**
- **Point:** No exotic materials. No new fab equipment needed.
- **Partners:** Compatible with TSMC N5/N3, Samsung Foundry.
- **Timeline:** Prototype to Mass Production reduced from 5 years to 18 months.

**Slide 12: Go-To-Market Strategy**
- **Phases:**
    1.  **IP Licensing (Arm Model):** License cores to Samsung/Qualcomm for mobile.
    2.  **Chiplets:** Sell physical silicon tiles for data centers.
    3.  **Full SoC:** Standalone Edge AI chips.

**Slide 13: Competitive Landscape**
- **Matrix:** Power vs Performance.
- **Players:** NVIDIA (High Power/High Perf), ARM (Low Power/Med Perf), Pentary (Low Power/High Perf).
- **Visual:** Quadrant chart positioning Pentary in the empty "Magic Quadrant".

**Slide 14: The "Moat" (IP Protection)**
- **Patents:** 20+ Core Patents on Pentary Logic Gates, Arithmetic, and Encoding.
- **Defensibility:** Even if competitors have 3nm fabs, they can't run Pentary math without our IP.

### Section 5: Financials & Roadmap
**Slide 15: Roadmap: 24-Month Execution**
- **Q1-Q2:** FPGA Validation (Complete).
- **Q3-Q4:** "Tape-out" (Design sent to Fab) on 28nm test node.
- **Year 2:** Production silicon on 5nm.
- **Visual:** Timeline Gantt chart.

**Slide 16: Revenue Projections (Revised for CMOS)**
- **Acceleration:** Revenue starts earlier due to faster manufacturing.
- **Chart:** 5-year bar chart showing aggressive growth from IP licensing fees.
- **Target:** $100M ARR by Year 3.

**Slide 17: Unit Economics**
- **Cost:** Smaller die size = more chips per wafer.
- **Yield:** Standard process = high yield (>90%).
- **Margin:** Estimated 70% gross margin on chips, 95% on IP.
